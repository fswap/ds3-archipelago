## From Software Archipelago Clients

This is a shared repo for several From Software Archipelago clients that share
the same underlying infrastructure. It currently contains a client for Dark
Souls III, with support for Sekiro and Elden Ring planned for the future.

See [archipelago.gg] for general information about Archipelago, and [the Dark
Souls III setup guide] for instructions on setting up and using the Dark Souls
III Archipelago mod.
